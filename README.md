# kubernetes 
Kubernetes, in short, is an open source system for managing clusters of containers. To do this, it provides tools for deploying applications, scaling those application as needed, managing changes to existing containerized applications, and helps you optimize the use of the underlying hardware beneath your containers. Kubernetes is designed to be extensible and fault-tolerant by allowing application components to restart and move across systems as needed
# Who wrote Kubernetes.
Kubernetes was originally created by Google, who had been running similar systems to manage containers as a part of their internal infrastructure for many years prior to the announcement of Kubernetes as an open source project in 2014. Today, Kubernetes is a rapidly growing open source community, with engineers from Google, Red Hat, and many other companies actively contributing to the project.

Additionally, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, a project of the Linux Foundation, operates to provide a common home for development of Kubernetes and other applications seeking to offer modern application infrastructure solutions
# How does Kubernetes work?

The main unit of organization in Kubernetes is called a pod. A pod is a group of containers that are administered as a group on the same machine or virtual machine, a node, and are designed to be able to talk to one another easily
# Features of Kubernetes

Following are some of the important features of Kubernetes.
 Continues development, integration and deployment
 Containerized infrastructure
 Application-centric management
 Auto-scalable infrastructure
 Environment consistency across development testing and production
 Loosely coupled infrastructure, where each component can act as a separate unit
 Higher density of resource utilization
 Predictable infrastructure which is going to be created
One of the key components of Kubernetes is, it can run application on clusters of physical 
and virtual machine infrastructure. It also has the capability to run applications on cloud. 
It helps in moving from host-centric infrastructure to container-centric 
infrastructure.
